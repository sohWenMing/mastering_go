# this is an example of a unit file - thie uuids.service file found in
# /lib/serviced/service

# there are three sections : [Unit] [Service] [Install]
# these three sections NEED to be in brackets and the first letter needs to be capitalised 
# the compiler is expecting this 

# the [Unit] is a general description of the unit - 
# these requirements seem to be things that need to be loaded before this service can be started  
# there can also be Wants=<> which can also be used to denote a requirement the main difference between
# wants and requires is that things listed in wants can be a soft dependency, preferred, but not a 
# show stopper in the case that the service cannot be loaded
